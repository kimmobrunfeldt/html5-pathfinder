Path finder
===========

![LOGO](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/html5-pathfinder/raw/master/img/path.png)

Visualisation of path finding with canvas using Dijkstra's algorithm.
It also uses a map preprocessing algorithm that I've made to reduce the amount of calculation work.

See demo: http://www.students.tut.fi/~brunfeld/html5-pathfinder/.

For this kind of path finding, Jump Point Search would be the best algorithm, see http://harablog.wordpress.com/2011/09/07/jump-point-search/.
